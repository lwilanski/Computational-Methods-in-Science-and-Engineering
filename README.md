# Computational Methods in Science and Engineering

## Course Description
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for the assignments of the Computational Methods in Science and Engineering course. The course focused on how mathematical operations are performed on a computer, introducing the basic concepts and most common numerical algorithms. Students were allowed to use any programming language; I chose Python and Jupyter Notebooks to complete my assignments.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by lab sessions. Each Jupyter Notebook file corresponds to a specific lab session held during the course. Each file contains the implementation of algorithms and solutions to the problems given during that lab.
